# COZMO 3d Viewer

<img src = "https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?label=build&message=ready&color=green">

The 3DVIEWER batch file starts the Cozmo 3d viewer SDK for Windows.  The proper Python libraries must be installed and the SDK example project must be downloaded.  Once you download the batch file, open it in your favorite code editor and change the directory to where the SDK is located.  
The Cozmo 3D Viewer does not work without the FREEGLUT libraries, which are the three DLL files.  These need to be placed in the C:\Windows\ directory.
