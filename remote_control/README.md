# COZMO Remote Control

Cozmo's Remote Control is a little different than his 3D Viewer- it doesn't show 3d positioning, but it does let you show emotions on his face.  This program runs through a web browser, therefore it requires Flask.  You can install Flask by running the FLASK_INSTALL batch file.
